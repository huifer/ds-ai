**WellAlly Health** is a local-first, AI-powered **personal health record (PHR)** system. It turns your medical reports, prescriptions, imaging, and daily health tracking into a private, searchable, structured knowledge base that runs entirely on your own machine — no cloud, no database server, no account required.

## Why WellAlly Health

Your health data is scattered across hospital portals, paper printouts, photos, and memory. Commercial apps ask you to upload it to *their* cloud. WellAlly Health takes the opposite approach:

- **🔒 Truly private** — everything lives in plain files on your disk. Nothing leaves your machine.
- **📄 Zero effort ingestion** — drop in a photo of a lab report or discharge summary; AI extracts the structured data for you.
- **🧠 AI that knows your history** — drug-interaction checks, multi-specialty analysis, and trend tracking all understand *your* records.
- **🗂️ One searchable source of truth** — biochemical values, imaging, surgeries, radiation exposure, medications, and allergies in one place.
- **♻️ Yours forever** — open JSON + Markdown format, no lock-in, easy to back up or export.

WellAlly Health is the **personal health record (PHR)** / **personal health information system (PHIS)** for people who want AI assistance *without* surrendering their medical privacy.
